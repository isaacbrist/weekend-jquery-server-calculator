# Weekend jquery Salary Calculator

## Description

Duration: Base Mode: 12 Hours.

I needed to create a calculator that had two inputs that could collect two numbers and handle one of four different mathematical operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

I needed to add an '=' button that would send the data to the server to be calculated and to store the information. Then the information would be appended to the DOM and clear the input fields.

I created a 'C' button that clears the input fields and the current operator.
